Face recognition is a technique for verifying or identifying a person's identity by analysing and connecting patterns based on the person's facial characteristics, however it is only useful in circumstances when the person's identity is at risk. Face detection is a technique for detecting a person's face in a photograph or video. It's all part of the Object detection process. Face detection might be considered the initial stage in the Face Recognition process. A Deep Face Recognition system with a face detector and alignment is being developed.
